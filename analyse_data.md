## Competencies

Analyse data and report on the use of specific measurements (particularly in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, bias, specificity and sensitivity) in the context of bioinformatics.

## Knowledge and skills you might demonstrate

- Sources of appropriate literature relating to the technical, scientific and clinical basis of clinical measurements.
- Common artefacts in equipment calibration and performance.
- Statistical tests applied to clinical measuring data to measure accuracy, precision, resolution and bias.
- Range of statistical tests and the appropriate choice for each situation.
- Use of commonly available databases, spreadsheets and statistics packages.
- Concept of Patient Identifiable Data and the process of de-identification for both teaching and research purposes.
- Governance and ethical issues surrounding such secondary use of data.

## Importance of Reproducibility

Within the clinical environment and the concurrent testing theat follows, the imporance of high levels of reproducibility of sufficiently accurate, precise and reliable results is of the utomost importance. Before patients are even considered, from an economical standpoint Freedman et al (2015) links low reproducibility of research with increased delays and cost of development. The advancement of medical research is also reliant on the fact that knowledge gained from research can be reproduced in a robust and reliable manner. If this is not the case, such research will not provide a firm enough base for which further advances can be developed upon (Begley et al 2015, McNutt 2014).

This perspective on reproducibility gathered from research tranfers smoothly over to the  aspect of clinical care. If a given test procedure is not reproducibile between individuals it can not then be considered reliable. Unreproducibility of results will  not allow for these measurements to be compared against a "normal" value. As such, clinical measurements taken from an unreprodubilbe test will not be substantial to make informed decisions on treatment.

## Identifiable Data

Data gathered foor this exercisesed was obtained by undertaking ultrasound scans from the Common and Internal Carotid Arteries. The data gathered from the scans has been anonymised to protect confidentiality of the individual whom they were taken from.

To ensure reproducibility of the results, the following factors were kept idencital throughout the process
- Same Operator
- Same Ultrasound Scanner/Probe
- Results were one after another over a space of 15 minutes
- Same method of data retrieval was undertaken for each measurement
- Same location throughout the procedure
- Same Environmental Conditions
- Same state of the subject (Resting State)

## Common Artefacts in Ultrasound performance

Often occur due to various occurences, such includes:
- Operator Error
- Physical Principles
- Equipment Malfunction/Design


The wave transmitted travels in a direct line from the probe(transducer) to an obect, then is reflected back to the probe(transducer). A signal is created depending upon the distance in which the wave was required to travel to and from the point of reflection. An increase in wavelength of the transmitted wave will result in greater penetrance of the signal, but will adverseley affect resolution.

### Catagories of Artefacts

- Image detail resolution related
- Locational artifacts
- Attenuation artifacts
- Doppler artifacts
